# Parcel Bundler
This is my first use of parcel to test and learn how it works.

### My notes
> mkdir projectName
> yarn init -y
> mkdir src
Make html, css, and javascript files and link them the normal way.
> yarn add parcel-bundler
> parcel src/index.html

Once we are happy with our project and ready to build production version
> parcel build src/index.html
